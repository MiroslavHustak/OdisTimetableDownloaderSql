Hromadné stahování JŘ ODIS 

Stále ve vývojové fázi... :-)

Under development (a re-write of my old console app)

Bulk downloading of timetables from the ODIS public transport system in Northern Moravia and (a part of) Silesia (these lands are located in the north-eastern part of the Czech Republic, in case you happen not to know it :-) ).

My original app contained improper error handling, which has now been mostly adapted into the idiomatic style using the Result type, except in the KODIS_Submain and KODIS_SubmainDatatable modules where proper adaptation will have to wait until the implementation of the 'mobile platform' variant.
